Post mortem

Challenges:

	I found my greatest challenge was the language itself. I could figure out what needed to be said immediately, but the actual code kept eluding me until someone came along to help me out.

Strengths:

	Pseudo code is my best friend. Without it I would never be able to do anything. With it I was able to figure stuff out so I could start looking how to code it.

What would I do differently:

	I would probably ask for help sooner.
